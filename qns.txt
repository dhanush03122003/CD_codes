week 1:

3. write a program to read no of lines, no of words, no of digits, no of vowels and no of consonants


week 2:

1. write a lex program to read a txt into the program and display the number of vowels, digits, consonants and special characters in the given input

2.  write a lex program to read the filename as an input and display the number of lines, number of words, no of characters and no of digits in the given input file


week 3:


1.
write a lex program, to read an input text to display if the word is int, float, char, else,if or display if a is identifier or keyword.

2.
write a lex program read an input text & display the no of identifiers, lines, integers and floating point numbers are existing in given text

3. 
wria bte a lex program to accept or reject any regular expression with a sub string 010. Binary string

4.
lex file through command line


week 4:

1. /* LEX Program for identifying
Keywords: int, char, double, void, main
Identifier: letter (letter digit) * and
storing in Symbol table
Integer and Float*/

2. Lex Program dealing with comments

week 5:

1. Write a lex program to take the file name as an input. Need to apply the lexical analyser on the input file contents. if the lexime is part of the single line comment or multiline comment need to ignore that laxime. if it is not part of the comment and it is any one of the following then display it as a keyword(int, char, float, double, void, return). if the lexeme is not a keyword and starts with a letter followed by a letter/digit combination then display it as an identifier, insert the identifier in the symbol table. if the lexeme is an integer display it as an integer, if the lexeme is a floating point value display it as float.

week 6:

1. I enclosed the code to find the FIRST and Follow of every variable. The code will work for FIRST; it needs to modify the code of FOLLOW. Do the modification and submit the modified code as an assignment.

week 7:

1. FIRST and FOLLOW


week 8:

1. Recursive Descent Parser


2. I enclosed the code for the recursive decent parser for the following grammar.
